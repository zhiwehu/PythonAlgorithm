# Python-Data-Structures-Implementation:

All the data structures including:

* Singly linklist
* Doubly linklist
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search tree
* Graph
* Pairing heaps etc 

 are implemented in this repository along with their relevant functions. 

##### Post Script:

* It was an empty, forked repository earlier and it is intended to make a PR daily with a new data stucture so presence of any specific data structure is subjected to its pull request. If its not found, it will be uploaded later.
* View Branches for unavailable data structure as I'm waiting to get a merge with the original repo.
